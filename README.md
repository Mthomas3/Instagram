### 👀 Story

The story of InstagramLike. While it is summer, vacation and relaxing. I decided to challenge myself, and try to clone Instagram with a limited time of and only 3 hours. The goal was to get as close as possible and to do as much features as possible. For this challenge, I started with nothing except a good understanding of the Instagram UI. Obviously, the application is far from done but it was FUN.

### 👀 Usage

If you are really interested with the result and want to clone it, you can just download it and it will run, no configuration is needed.

### 🔨  Architecture

Of course with a limited time of 3 hours, the architecture and good practices wasn't my priority.
However, the application does not have any mocked data and the data of the stories, images, profile pictures etc.. is being fetch from a server!
I used the website https://jsonbin.io to make the data from the back-end it's powerful, fast and took me 3 secondes to get it working 🎉 (no really it took me 10 minutes cause I had to write down the data 😂)
