### 👀 Story

While it is summer, vacation and relaxing I had an idea to challenge myself. The challenge was to create a clone of Instagram in 3 hours. Obviously to goal here is not to finish the app or to show the best iOS practices, but it was to see how quick I could go. Here is the result of the challenge, I managed to have the feed display with stories on top. On the stories, the pictures of the users are being fetch from a back server that has been set during the challenge. On top of that you can view a story of a user by clicking on their stories. This challenge was fun, and I will probably do the swiftUI version of it soon!!!

### 👀 Usage

If you are really interested with the result and want to clone it, you can just download it and it will run, no configuration is needed.

### 🔨  Architecture

Of course with a limited time of 3 hours, the architecture and good practices weren't my priority.
However, the application does not have any mocked data and the data of the stories, images, profile pictures etc.. are being fetch from a server!
I used the website https://jsonbin.io to make the data from the back-end, it's powerful, fast and took me 3 seconds to get it working 🎉 (no really it took me 10 minutes cause I had to write down the data 😂)
